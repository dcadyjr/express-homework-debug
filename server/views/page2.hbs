<h3>I am a creative who enjoys building things from scratch. After dabbling in HTML at different jobs and my personal life I decided to jump in feet first and learn Full Stack Web Development.  An actor buy trade, I am comfortable with creative process and I get a kick out of collaborating with others. I like learning new things or searching for new ways to do things. </h3>
